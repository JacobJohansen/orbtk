/// Used to define a state of a [`widget`].
///
/// The state holds the logic of a widget which makes it interactive.
/// The state of a widget is made of a struct which implements this trait with its fields and its methods.
/// A state of a widget is represented by the current values of its properties.
/// Each state has to implement this trait.
/// Each state has to derive or implement the [Default](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html) and the [`AsAny`] traits.
/// A state is operating on the properties (components) of the widget, its parent or children, or the state's fields.
/// It is not mandatory to have a state for a widget (in this case it will be static).
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// use orbtk::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Default, AsAny)]
/// struct MyState {
///     count: usize
/// }
///
/// impl State for MyState {
///     fn init(&mut self, _ctx: &mut Context, _res: &mut Resources) {
///         self.count = 42;
///         println!("MyState initialized.");
///     }
///
///     fn update(&mut self, _ctx: &mut Context, _res: &mut Resources) {
///         self.count += 1;
///         println("MyState updated.");
///     }
